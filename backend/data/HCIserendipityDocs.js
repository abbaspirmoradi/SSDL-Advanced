                    "This exploratory study investigates the rationale behind categorizing algorithmic controls, or algorithmic affordances, in the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of recommender systems. Seven professionals from industry and academia took part in an open card sorting activity to analyze 45 cards with examples of algorithmic affordances in recommender systems’ GUIs. Their objective was to identify potential design patterns including features on which to base these patterns. Analyzing the group discussions revealed distinct thought processes and defining factors for design patterns that were shared by academic and industry partners. While the discussions were promising, they also demonstrated a varying degree of alignment between industry and academia when it came to labelling the identified categories. Since this workshop is part of the preparation for creating a design pattern library of algorithmic affordances, and since the library aims to be useful for both industry and research partners, further research into design patterns of algorithmic affordances, particularly in terms of labelling and description, is required in order to establish categories that resonate with all relevant parties."

Recommender systems automatically generate product recommendations: customers profit from a faster finding of relevant products, stores profit from rising sales. All aspects of recommender systems are covered: the economic background, mechanism design, a survey of systems in the Internet, statistical methods and algorithms, service oriented architectures, user interfaces, as well as experiences and data from real-world applications.

                    "Music recommender systems typically offer a “one-size-fits-all” approach with the same user controls and visualizations for all users. However, the effectiveness of interactive interfaces for music recommender systems is likely to be affected by individual differences. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive literature review of interactive interfaces in recommender systems to motivate the need for personalized interaction with music recommender systems, and two personal characteristics,  \nvisual memory\nand \nmusical sophistication\n. More specifically, we studied the influence of these characteristics on the design of (a)\nvisualizations\nfor enhancing recommendation diversity and (b) the optimal level of\nuser controls\nwhile minimizing cognitive load. The results of three experiments show a benefit for personalizing both visualization and control elements to musical sophistication. We found that (1)\nmusical sophistication\ninfluenced the acceptance of recommendations for\nuser controls\n. (2)\nmusical sophistication\nalso influenced recommendation acceptance, and perceived diversity for\nvisualizations\nand the UI combining user controls and visualizations. However, musical sophistication only strengthens the impact of UI on perceived diversity (moderation effect) when studying the combined effect of controls and visualizations. These results allow us to extend the model for personalization in music recommender systems by providing guidelines for interactive visualization design for music recommender systems, with regard to both visualizations and user control."

                    "The design of recommender systems’ graphical user interfaces (GUIs) is critical for a user's experience with these systems. However, most research into recommenders focuses on algorithms, overlooking the design of their interfaces. Additionally, the studies on the design of recommender interfaces that do exist do not always manage to cross the research-practice gap. This disconnect may be due to a lack of alignment between academic focus and the most pressing needs of practitioners, as well as the way research findings are communicated. To address these issues, this paper presents the results of a comprehensive study involving 215 designers worldwide, aiming to identify the primary challenges in designing recommender GUIs and the resources practitioners need to tackle those challenges. Building on these findings, this paper proposes a practice-led research agenda for the human-computer interaction community on designing recommender interfaces and suggestions for more accessible and actionable ways of disseminating research results in this domain."

                    "The design of recommender systems’ graphical user interfaces (GUIs) is critical for a user's experience with these systems. However, most research into recommenders focuses on algorithms, overlooking the design of their interfaces. Additionally, the studies on the design of recommender interfaces that do exist do not always manage to cross the research-practice gap. This disconnect may be due to a lack of alignment between academic focus and the most pressing needs of practitioners, as well as the way research findings are communicated. To address these issues, this paper presents the results of a comprehensive study involving 215 designers worldwide, aiming to identify the primary challenges in designing recommender GUIs and the resources practitioners need to tackle those challenges. Building on these findings, this paper proposes a practice-led research agenda for the human-computer interaction community on designing recommender interfaces and suggestions for more accessible and actionable ways of disseminating research results in this domain."

                    "Research on recommender systems typically focuses on the accuracy of prediction algorithms. Because accuracy only partially constitutes the user experience of a recommender system, this paper proposes a framework that takes a user-centric approach to recommender system evaluation. The framework links objective system aspects to objective user behavior through a series of perceptual and evaluative constructs (called subjective system aspects and experience, respectively). Furthermore, it incorporates the influence of personal and situational characteristics on the user experience. This paper reviews how current literature maps to the framework and identifies several gaps in existing work. Consequently, the framework is validated with four field trials and two controlled experiments and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. The results of these studies show that subjective system aspects and experience variables are invaluable in\nexplaining why and how the user experience of recommender systems comes about\n. In all studies we observe that perceptions of recommendation quality and/or variety are important mediators in predicting the effects of objective system aspects on the three components of user experience: process (e.g. perceived effort, difficulty), system (e.g. perceived system effectiveness) and outcome (e.g. choice satisfaction). Furthermore, we find that these subjective aspects have strong and sometimes interesting behavioral correlates (e.g. reduced browsing indicates higher system effectiveness). They also show several tradeoffs between system aspects and personal and situational characteristics (e.g. the amount of preference feedback users provide is a tradeoff between perceived system usefulness and privacy concerns). These results, as well as the validated framework itself, provide a platform for future research on the user-centric evaluation of recommender systems."

                    "Scholarly recommender systems attempt to reduce the number of research resources or papers presented to scholars and predict the utility of resources for their scholarly tasks. Industry practitioners and academic researchers agree that the interface of a recommender system may have as profound an effect on users’ experience as the recommender’s algorithmic performance. Despite this, little attention has been given to User Interface and Interaction Design of scholarly recommender systems. Scholarly recommender systems rarely use contextual data, such as personal and situational characteristics, that can dramatically affect the user experience (UX) and effectiveness of SRSs. This research presents rScholar, a scholarly recommender system interface that utilizes User Interface and Interaction Design adequacy indicators as well as the user contextual data to enhance the user experience. The evaluation of rScholar is performed by user studies and expert review of feedback by users and by comparison to the UI of the recommendation display of Google Scholar."

                    "Scholarly recommender systems attempt to reduce the number of research resources or papers presented to scholars and predict the utility of resources for their scholarly tasks. Industry practitioners and academic researchers agree that the interface of a recommender system may have as profound an effect on users’ experience as the recommender’s algorithmic performance. Despite this, little attention has been given to User Interface and Interaction Design of scholarly recommender systems. Scholarly recommender systems rarely use contextual data, such as personal and situational characteristics, that can dramatically affect the user experience (UX) and effectiveness of SRSs. This research presents rScholar, a scholarly recommender system interface that utilizes User Interface and Interaction Design adequacy indicators as well as the user contextual data to enhance the user experience. The evaluation of rScholar is performed by user studies and expert review of feedback by users and by comparison to the UI of the recommendation display of Google Scholar."

                    "A recommender system is a Web technology that proactively suggests items of interest to users based on their objective behavior or explicitly stated preferences. Evaluations of recommender systems (RS) have traditionally focused on the performance of algorithms. However, many researchers have recently started investigating system effectiveness and evaluation criteria from users’ perspectives. In this paper, we survey the state of the art of user experience research in RS by examining how researchers have evaluated design methods that augment RS’s ability to help users find the information or product that they truly prefer, interact with ease with the system, and form trust with RS through system transparency, control and privacy preserving mechanisms finally, we examine how these system design features influence users’ adoption of the technology. We summarize existing work concerning three crucial interaction activities between the user and the system: the initial preference elicitation process, the preference refinement process, and the presentation of the system’s recommendation results. Additionally, we will also cover recent evaluation frameworks that measure a recommender system’s overall perceptive qualities and how these qualities influence users’ behavioral intentions. The key results are summarized in a set of design guidelines that can provide useful suggestions to scholars and practitioners concerning the design and development of effective recommender systems. The survey also lays groundwork for researchers to pursue future topics that have not been covered by existing methods."

We present the results of a preliminary user study on talk recommendations in the context of a conference with n=37 people that used our system under one of two conditions: a static list of recommendations, or the enhanced visual controllable interface. The user behavioral analysis and the results of a survey that n=17 users answered provide interesting insights for designers and developers of interfaces for recommender systems, especially when the items can have one or more contexts of relevancy as in a hybrid recommender system."

Studies on conversational user interfaces (CUIs) typically examine how conversations can be facilitated (i.e., optimizing the means). Recommender systems research (RecSys) aims to retrieve and present recommendations in a user’s session (i.e., optimizing the ends). Though these aims are overlapping across both areas, they can be better examined together to target the means and ends of what people can achieve with technology as conversational recommender systems (CRSs).

                    "This paper considers unifying research on conversational user interfaces and recommender systems. Studies on conversational user interfaces (CUIs) typically examine how conversations can be facilitated (i.e., optimizing the means). Recommender systems research (RecSys) aims to retrieve and present recommendations in a user’s session (i.e., optimizing the ends). Though these aims are overlapping across both areas, they can be better examined together to target the means and ends of what people can achieve with technology as conversational recommender systems (CRSs). We discuss the intersection of conversational user interfaces, recommender systems, and conversational recommender systems. We argue how conversations and recommendations can be designed holistically, in which recommendations can also be a means to foster engaging conversational interaction, while conversations as ends can better sustain curated, long-term recommendations."

                    "Recommendations with personalized explanations have been shown to increase user trust and perceived quality and help users make better decisions. Moreover, such explanations allow users to provide feedback by critiquing them. Several algorithms for recommender systems with multi-step critiquing have therefore been developed. However, providing a user-friendly interface based on personalized explanations and critiquing has not been addressed in the last decade. In this paper, we introduce four different web interfaces (available under https://lia.epfl.ch/critiquing/) helping users making decisions and finding their ideal item. We have chosen the hotel recommendation domain as a use case even though our approach is trivially adaptable for other domains. Moreover, our system is model-agnostic (for both recommender systems and critiquing models) allowing a great flexibility and further extensions. Our interfaces are above all a useful tool to help research in recommendation with critiquing. They allow to test such systems on a real use case and also to highlight some limitations of these approaches to find solutions to overcome them."

                    "In recent years, researchers in the field of recommender systems have explored a range of advanced interfaces to improve user interactions with recommender systems. Some of the major research ideas explored in this new area include the explainability and controllability of recommendations.\nControllability\nenables end users to participate in the recommendation process by providing various kinds of input.\nExplainability\nfocuses on making the recommendation process and the reasons behind specific recommendation more clear to the users. While each of these approaches contributes to making traditional “black-box” recommendation more attractive and acceptable to end users, little is known about how these approaches work together. In this paper, we investigate the effects of adding user control and visual explanations in a specific context of an interactive hybrid social recommender system. We present\nRelevance Tuner+\n, a hybrid recommender system that allows the users to control the fusion of multiple recommender sources while also offering explanations of both the fusion process and each of the source recommendations. We also report the results of a controlled study (\nN\n = 50) that explores the impact of controllability and explainability in this context."

                    "In recent years, researchers in the field of recommender systems have explored a range of advanced interfaces to improve user interactions with recommender systems. Some of the major research ideas explored in this new area include the explainability and controllability of recommendations.\nControllability\nenables end users to participate in the recommendation process by providing various kinds of input.\nExplainability\nfocuses on making the recommendation process and the reasons behind specific recommendation more clear to the users. While each of these approaches contributes to making traditional “black-box” recommendation more attractive and acceptable to end users, little is known about how these approaches work together. In this paper, we investigate the effects of adding user control and visual explanations in a specific context of an interactive hybrid social recommender system. We present\nRelevance Tuner+\n, a hybrid recommender system that allows the users to control the fusion of multiple recommender sources while also offering explanations of both the fusion process and each of the source recommendations. We also report the results of a controlled study (\nN\n = 50) that explores the impact of controllability and explainability in this context."
