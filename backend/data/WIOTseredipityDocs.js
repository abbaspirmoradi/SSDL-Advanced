                                            "The proliferation of powerful but cheap devices, together with the availability of a plethora of wireless technologies, has pushed for the spread of the Wireless Internet of Things (WIoT), which is typically much more heterogeneous, dynamic, and general-purpose if compared with the traditional IoT. The WIoT is characterized by the dynamic interaction of traditional infrastructure-side devices, e.g., sensors and actuators, provided by municipalities in Smart City infrastructures, and other portable and more opportunistic ones, such as mobile smartphones, opportunistically integrated to dynamically extend and enhance the WIoT environment. A key enabler of this vision is the advancement of software and middleware technologies in various mobile-related sectors, ranging from the effective synergic management of wireless communications to mobility/adaptivity support in operating systems and differentiated integration and management of devices with heterogeneous capabilities in middleware, from horizontal support to crowdsourcing in different application domains to dynamic offloading to cloud resources, only to mention a few. The book presents state-of-the-art contributions in the articulated WIoT area by providing novel insights about the development and adoption of middleware solutions to enable the WIoT vision in a wide spectrum of heterogeneous scenarios, ranging from industrial environments to educational devices. The presented solutions provide readers with differentiated point of views, by demonstrating how the WIoT vision can be applied to several aspects of our daily life in a pervasive manner."

                                            "The proliferation of powerful but cheap devices, together with the availability of a plethora of wireless technologies, has pushed for the spread of the Wireless Internet of Things (WIoT), which is typically much more heterogeneous, dynamic, and general-purpose if compared with the traditional IoT. The WIoT is characterized by the dynamic interaction of traditional infrastructure-side devices, e.g., sensors and actuators, provided by municipalities in Smart City infrastructures, and other portable and more opportunistic ones, such as mobile smartphones, opportunistically integrated to dynamically extend and enhance the WIoT environment. A key enabler of this vision is the advancement of software and middleware technologies in various mobile-related sectors, ranging from the effective synergic management of wireless communications to mobility/adaptivity support in operating systems and differentiated integration and management of devices with heterogeneous capabilities in middleware, from horizontal support to crowdsourcing in different application domains to dynamic offloading to cloud resources, only to mention a few. The book presents state-of-the-art contributions in the articulated WIoT area by providing novel insights about the development and adoption of middleware solutions to enable the WIoT vision in a wide spectrum of heterogeneous scenarios, ranging from industrial environments to educational devices. The presented solutions provide readers with differentiated point of views, by demonstrating how the WIoT vision can be applied to several aspects of our daily life in a pervasive manner."

                                            "Currently, there are 17 billion IoT nodes, mostly powered by cables or batteries, leading to high maintenance costs and increased risk of data loss during power outages. Although a self‐sustaining IoT node holds potential to tackle this issue, it faces the challenges of obtaining stable, uninterrupted energy sources and maintaining adequate power efficiency. This study introduces a fully irradiated, 24‐h self‐sustaining flexible node (SSN) that is highly integrated with sensors, energy storage, wireless data transmission, and power supply units, specifically a flexible perovskite solar cell module (FPSM). The FPSM enables stable energy supply across diverse indoor and outdoor irradiance conditions, while the SSN employs a smart energy management system to optimize power utilization and distribution. Additionally, wireless data transmission is achieved by a low‐power consumption Zigbee module, enabling dependable 24‐h indoor environmental monitoring and extensive 3D data collection across “indoor‐outdoor‐aerial” environments. Finally, the integration of feedback and control systems allows the FPSM‐SSN to serve as a smart home hub, seamlessly combining sensing and actuation functionalities to enhance system efficiency and functionality."

                                            "The proliferation of wireless devices and appliances is facilitating the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT). Numerous state-of-the-art applications are being used in, for example, smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and biocomputing. With the popularization of IoT, new challenges are emerging with respect to privacy issues. In this article, we first summarize privacy constraints and primary attacks based on new features of IoT. Then we present three case studies to demonstrate principal vulnerabilities and classify existing protection schemes. Built on this analysis, we identify three key challenges: a lack of theoretical foundation, the trade-off optimization between privacy and data utility, and system isomerism over-complexity and high scalability. Finally, we illustrate possible promising future directions and potential solutions to the emerging challenges facing wireless IoT scenarios. We aim to assist interested readers in investigating the unexplored parts of this promising domain."

                                            "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and wireless technology are driving forward the large deployment of interconnected smart technologies that constitute cyber-physical systems (CPSs) and Internet of Things (IoT) for many commercial and military applications. CPS is characterized by communication, computing, and control engineering based on a large volume of data originating from various devices, plants, sensors, etc. Wireless technologies have enabled the ease of networking and communications for both CPS and IoT, by providing massive and critical connectivity and control mechanisms. However, they are prone to challenges, such as low latency, throughput, and scheduling. Recent research trends focus on how to intelligently use data from CPS units to enhance wireless connectivity in CPS. AI tools, particularly AI systems and machine learning (ML) algorithms, have been widely applied in the literature to develop efficient schemes for wireless CPS/IoT. This article presents a review on the role of AI in wireless networking for CPS and IoT. In particular, we focus on ML paradigms, such as transfer learning (TL), distributed learning, and federated learning, that have evolved as building blocks for the utilization of large data for learning, adaptation, and predictions in CPS and IoT systems that leverage wireless networking. Furthermore, we also highlight challenges faced by current and future wireless networks pertaining to CPS/IoT, which are yet to be addressed."

                                            "An infrastructure that provides geospatial analysis, better understands simulations, great potential for visualizing natural and artificial landscapes, and the universal recognition of the use of the Wireless Internet of Things. Everyday devices, whose platform is the Internet of Things, will be smarter in their daily processing, richer in their daily communication, and smarter. The Wireless Internet of Things still wants its landscape design. Still, its impact is already looking at the scene where the Wireless Internet of Things and GIS (Geographic Information System) systems were connected to make incredible advances. It opens up architecture-specific research and the usual architectural landscape area. It can be used for soil mapping studies and can be used for remote sensing in other engineering areas to obtain a wide range of weather compensation. It encourages the use of geographic information systems for geotechnical applications in soil. Geographic information systems can manipulate georeferenced information to be displayed, store, assemble and create georeferenced data from existing data, and generate multiple missing spatial data based on the attributes attached to it. The system briefly introduces street architecture landscape applications and promotes a street landscape design environment for Wireless Internet of Things and GIS system architecture. The proposed system is described as a thing and GIS as network technology, especially in smart design, street architecture and landscape wireless network connectivity. This is an overview of smart network providers, first to help explore some essential landscapes, equipped with wireless internet and geographic information systems, and how it is used in street architecture."

Everyday devices, whose platform is the Internet of Things, will be smarter in their daily processing, richer in their daily communication, and smarter. The Wireless Internet of Things still wants its landscape design. Still, its impact is already looking at the scene where the Wireless Internet of Things and GIS (Geographic Information System) systems were connected to make incredible advances. It opens up architecture-specific research and the usual architectural landscape area. It can be used for soil mapping studies and can be used for remote sensing in other engineering areas to obtain a wide range of weather compensation. It encourages the use of geographic information systems for geotechnical applications in soil. Geographic information systems can manipulate georeferenced information to be displayed, store, assemble and create georeferenced data from existing data, and generate multiple missing spatial data based on the attributes attached to it. The system briefly introduces street architecture landscape applications and promotes a street landscape design environment for Wireless Internet of Things and GIS system architecture. The proposed system is described as a thing and GIS as network technology, especially in smart design, street architecture and landscape wireless network connectivity. This is an overview of smart network providers, first to help explore some essential landscapes, equipped with wireless internet and geographic information systems, and how it is used in street architecture."

The front‐to‐back ratio and gain enhancements of the proposed antenna with an overall size of 0.44 λ0 × 0.44 λ0 × 0.17 λ0 at 2.545 GHz were designed and accomplished utilizing a cavity‐backed reflector. The impedance bandwidth based on the 10 dB return loss and the peak gain of the proposed antenna are approximately 18.8% (2.26–2.73 GHz) and 7.42 dBi, respectively."

According to the data obtained from the questionnaire, 56.16% of the students believe that the current teaching progress is relatively fast, while the students themselves are poor in learning, and they hope that teachers will adopt differentiated teaching. Through the Internet of Things technology, teaching methods, teaching resources, high-quality teachers, and other related resources are integrated to form an open teaching environment. It focuses on bringing together in one place via object network of things information about special topics such as international teachers, current methods of living and popular ways of knowing foreign cultures, and lessons taught in particular institutions, which is conducive to cultivating students’ autonomous learning ability and learning thinking. Through RFID technology, it is transmitted to data information, processing system, or physical environment to realize the interconnection and interoperability of the Internet of Things era. No matter where, when, or what objects can communicate smoothly, teaching can be worry-free."
