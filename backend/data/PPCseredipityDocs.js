                        "Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks are important components of the smart grid (SG) for their capability of providing better ancillary services and facilitating the adoption of renewable resources. The operation of the V2G networks is based on continuously monitoring the status of individual battery vehicle (BV) as well as a carefully designed incentive scheme to attract sufficient participating BVs. However, the close monitoring tends to raise privacy concerns from the BV owners about identity and location information leakage, which have not been considered in previous works. In this paper, we make the first attempt to identify the privacy-preserving issues and propose a precise reward scheme in V2G networks, both of which are important towards bringing the concept of V2G network into practice. In V2G networks, it is the service providers (individual BVs) who need privacy protection rather than the service consumer (power grid). This unique characteristic renders privacy protection solutions proposed for conventional network systems not directly applicable. To protect privacy of BVs in V2G networks, we present , a secure communication architecture which achieves privacy-preserving for both BVs' monitoring and rewarding processes. Extensive performance analysis shows that only incurs moderate communication and computational overheads."

                        "Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks are important components of the smart grid (SG) for their capability of providing better ancillary services and facilitating the adoption of renewable resources. The operation of the V2G networks is based on continuously monitoring the status of individual battery vehicle (BV) as well as a carefully designed incentive scheme to attract sufficient participating BVs. However, the close monitoring tends to raise privacy concerns from the BV owners about identity and location information leakage, which have not been considered in previous works. In this paper, we make the first attempt to identify the privacy-preserving issues and propose a precise reward scheme in V2G networks, both of which are important towards bringing the concept of V2G network into practice. In V2G networks, it is the service providers (individual BVs) who need privacy protection rather than the service consumer (power grid). This unique characteristic renders privacy protection solutions proposed for conventional network systems not directly applicable. To protect privacy of BVs in V2G networks, we present , a secure communication architecture which achieves privacy-preserving for both BVs' monitoring and rewarding processes. Extensive performance analysis shows that only incurs moderate communication and computational overheads."

                        "Currently, at the dawn of 5G networks, and the era of the Internet-of-Things, wireless and mobile networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous. In this landscape, security and privacy turn into decisive factors. That is, the mobile and wireless ecosystem is an ideal playground for many perpetrators: (a) handheld devices are used for critical tasks, such as e-commerce, bank transactions, payments, application purchases, as well as social interaction; (b) such devices uniquely identify their users and store sensitive and detailed information about them; and (c) despite all their sophistication, native security mechanisms of mobile operating systems can be bypassed, and several wireless interfaces and protocols have been proven to be vulnerable to attack. As the attacker is given so many alternative entry points for penetration, the creation of assaults against the end-user and the underlying systems and services have been augmented, both in amount, as well as in matters of complexity. It is, therefore, imperative that new and advanced security and privacy-preserving measures are deployed. To cope with the aforementioned challenges, this edited book has been dedicated to the security and privacy aspects of mobile networks, wireless communications, and their apps. Particularly, apart from network and link layer security, the focus is on the security and privacy of mobile software platforms and the increasingly differing spectrum of mobile or wireless apps. This edited book presents a collection of nine chapters. All the chapters constitute original research work addressing a variety of topics pertaining to the above-mentioned challenges."

In particular, the book introduces asymmetric DC-Nets, which offer an ideal combination of performance and features in comparison with homomorphic encryption; data anonymization via cryptographic protocols; and data obfuscation by means of noise injection or by means of the installation of storage banks. The author shows that this theory can be leveraged into several application scenarios, and how asymmetric DC-Nets are generalizations of additive homomorphic encryption schemes and abstractions of symmetric DC-Nets. The book provides the reader with an understanding about smart grid scenarios, the privacy problem, and the mathematics and algorithms used to solve it."

                        "In this paper, we propose a timed efficient and secure vehicular communication (TSVC) scheme with privacy preservation, which aims at minimizing the packet overhead in terms of signature overhead and signature verification latency without compromising the security and privacy requirements. Compared with currently existing public key based packet authentication schemes for security and privacy, the communication and computation overhead of TSVC can be significantly reduced due to the short message authentication code (MAC) tag attached in each packet for the packet authentication, by which only a fast hash operation is required to verify each packet. Simulation results demonstrate that TSVC maintains acceptable packet latency with much less packet overhead, while significantly reducing the packet loss ratio compared with that of the existing public key infrastructure (PKI) based schemes, especially when the road traffic is heavy."

Compared with currently existing public key based packet authentication schemes for security and privacy, the communication and computation overhead of TSVC can be significantly reduced due to the short message authentication code (MAC) tag attached in each packet for the packet authentication, by which only a fast hash operation is required to verify each packet. Simulation results demonstrate that TSVC maintains acceptable packet latency with much less packet overhead, while significantly reducing the packet loss ratio compared with that of the existing public key infrastructure (PKI) based schemes, especially when the road traffic is heavy."

                        "Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks are important components of the smart grid (SG) for their capability of providing better ancillary services and facilitating the adoption of renewable resources. The operation of the V2G networks is based on continuously monitoring the status of individual battery vehicle (BV) as well as a carefully designed incentive scheme to attract sufficient participating BVs. However, the close monitoring tends to raise privacy concerns from the BV owners about identity and location information leakage, which have not been considered in previous works. In this paper, we make the first attempt to identify the privacy-preserving issues and propose a precise reward scheme in V2G networks, both of which are important towards bringing the concept of V2G network into practice. In V2G networks, it is the service providers (individual BVs) who need privacy protection rather than the service consumer (power grid). This unique characteristic renders privacy protection solutions proposed for conventional network systems not directly applicable. To protect privacy of BVs in V2G networks, we present , a secure communication architecture which achieves privacy-preserving for both BVs' monitoring and rewarding processes. Extensive performance analysis shows that only incurs moderate communication and computational overheads."
